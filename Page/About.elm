        [ p "Like most kids in the U.S., I went to school on the usual five day a week track for many years. I always enjoyed learning something new. Even more than that, I loved sharing that new piece of knowledge with those around me. If I learned something new at school, I would share it at home. If I learned something new at home, I would share it at school."
        , p "Slowly, school became less interesting to me. I was starting to do more tedious tasks. I didn't feel like I was learning as much anymore. The joy I had faded. I knew there had to be a better way to teach. I knew there had to be a better way to learn. I was going to figure out that way."
        , p "From an early age, I grew a strong desire to improve education. Continuing through schooling, that desire only became stronger."
        , p "When in college I decided on Computer Science as a major because I felt I could have the widest reach with this if I were to make any impact on education. I was lucky enough to get into the software industry straight out of college, but after a few years in the software industry, I do not feel anywhere close to my education goal."
        , p "I have come to learn that I need many years to make a quality educational game. It is challenging figuring out exactly how to structure a game, how to make a game enticing, how to make a game stick so people keep coming back, how to make that perfect educational game. I have some basic ideas of keeping the game simple, making it intuitive, having the learning being secondary to the task. But putting these things into practice and figuring out  all the little details of a game is extremely difficult."
        , p "I spend all the free time I have working towards my education passion in the best way I know how. But I do not know if I am spending enough time learning game programming, if I am spending enough time reaching out to educators to network, if I am spending enough time researching educational methods, or if I am spending enough time researching what games are already out there. I feel there is not enough time to do all the things I need to do."
        , p "I decided to re-prioritize. I no longer try to go through all my emails, I work on educational games instead. I try to keep other tasks as simple as possible and don't aim for perfection. This has given me even more time for working on educational games. My fiancÃ©e gave me a passion planner to help me schedule and I use this to dedicate time on my calendar each day to educational games. This helps ensure I work towards my goal every day. The passion planner is also nice because it reminds me look back at each month, evaluate, and improve for the next month, so I am constantly getting better month over month. Since she is trying to achieve her dream of being a professional aerial performer, we are always working together and constantly pushing each other to improve ourselves."
        , p "I heard a story about a ceramics teacher that split his class in two. One half produced as many pots as they could, the other had to produce one perfect pot. The half that produced more pots actually also produced better quality pots as well. So I am currently focused on building games from scratch, making as many games as I can, and seeing that quality increasing over time. If you want to join me on this educational journey, please reach out, I look forward to hearing from you."
